    First computes the most likely position of each ghost that 
    has not yet been captured, then chooses an action that brings 
    Pacman closer to the closest ghost (in maze distance!).
    
    To find the maze distance between any two positions, use:
    self.distancer.getDistance(pos1, pos2)
    
    To find the successor position of a position after an action:
    successorPosition = Actions.getSuccessor(position, action)
    
    livingGhostPositionDistributions, defined below, is a list of
    util.Counter objects equal to the position belief distributions
    for each of the ghosts that are still alive.  It is defined based
    on (these are implementation details about which you need not be
    concerned):

      1) gameState.getLivingGhosts(), a list of booleans, one for each
         agent, indicating whether or not the agent is alive.  Note
         that pacman is always agent 0, so the ghosts are agents 1,
         onwards (just as before).

      2) self.ghostBeliefs, the list of belief distributions for each
         of the ghosts (including ghosts that are not alive).  The
         indices into this list should be 1 less than indices into the
         gameState.getLivingGhosts() list.
     
    You may remove Directions.STOP from the list of available actions.
